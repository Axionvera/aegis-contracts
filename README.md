#  Aegis RWA Contracts

Core smart contract infrastructure for the Aegis RWA Protocol. Built on the Stellar network using the Soroban SDK.

## Overview
Aegis enables the fractional tokenization of Real-World Assets (RWAs). The contracts strictly enforce regulatory compliance at the ledger level, ensuring tokens can only be minted to and transferred between KYC-whitelisted addresses.

## Prerequisites
* [Rust](https://rustup.rs/) (>= 1.71)
* [Soroban CLI](https://soroban.stellar.org/docs/getting-started/setup)

## Setup & Build
1. Install the `wasm32-unknown-unknown` target:
   ```bash
   rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown
   ```
2. Build the contract:
   ```bash
   make build
   ```
   
## Testing
Run the comprehensive test suite locally:
   ```bash
   make test
   ```

> Before opening a PR, run `make verify` (fmt-check + clippy + test + build) -- this is the same gate CI enforces, and failing checks can block PR approval. See the CI & Contributing section below, especially the [Failing CI Response Guide](docs/failing-ci-guide.md), if anything fails.

### SDK integration fixtures
Deterministic example outputs for downstream SDK, dashboard, and indexer
repos live in [`fixtures/sdk/`](fixtures/sdk). They are generated from real
contract invocations and re-verified on every test run, so contract drift
fails CI here instead of reaching consumers. Event fixtures also assert the
exported typed payload, exact topic, caller, count, and ordering before their
JSON/XDR snapshots can be updated:
   ```bash
   make test-fixtures          # verify committed fixtures still match
   make update-fixtures        # regenerate after an intentional change
   ```
See [SDK Integration Fixtures](docs/sdk-fixtures.md) for the format, the
value-encoding rules, and the no-real-user-data guarantee.
## Security & Compliance

> **Important**: Please read our [Legal Boundary Disclaimer](docs/legal-boundary-disclaimer.md) to understand the off-chain assumptions and limitations of the RWA tokenization model.

- [RWA Protocol Threat Model](docs/threat-model.md) — protected assets, trust boundaries, threat catalog (compliance bypass, admin/role misuse, minting and transfer risks, pause misuse, event reliability), and explicit off-chain/legal out-of-scope items

- [Transfer Restriction Reason Codes](docs/transfer-restrictions.md) — granular blocked-transfer reasons (non-compliant sender/recipient, paused/retired/blocked asset, cap breaches, unauthorised operation), pre-flight reason reads, and the SDK/dashboard mapping contract

- [SDK Integration Fixtures](docs/sdk-fixtures.md) — deterministic example outputs for compliance, minting, transfer, event, error, and capability scenarios, for cross-repo testing

- [Contract Capability Flags](docs/capabilities.md) — read-only descriptor of which modules and protocol behaviours a deployment supports, for SDK/dashboard feature gating

## CI & Contributing

| Failure type | Where to look | Local fix command |
|---|---|---|
| Compilation error | `cargo build` output | `make build` |
| Test failure | `cargo test` output | `make test` |
| Formatting | unformatted files | `make fmt` (or `make fmt-check` to check only) |
| Lint warnings | `cargo clippy` output | `make clippy` |
| All of the above | full pre-push gate | `make verify` |
